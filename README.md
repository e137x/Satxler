[How to setup a mongoDB server on linux (Ubuntu)](https://youtu.be/JTvGImRESzg)

```YAML
First, setup a mongoDB database

After you're in the mongoDB shell (followed the tutorials above)

Run these commands:
```
```javascript

use Bot
db.whitelist.insertOne({useless: "github.com/weasley82ron"})
```

# MAKE SURE your bot has this intent (or it will not work):<img src="Intent.png">

# Now you're done! Either use the binaries or build it yourself, it's up to you.

# So, you want to build it yourself?

You will need these dependencies:

```YAML
install a particular node version 
Go n Create your mongo db url
Install dependencies and enjoy using the bot.
```

After you've installed the dependencies, you are good to run this command:

```YAML
cd (directory of the index.js file)

go and run "npm install"

(then you can also welcome to run it straight from the index file.)

node index.js
```
